Purchase the course pack for this section of Intro to Philosophy from Barnes \& Noble. It should also have my name (Johnson) on it somewhere.


\section{Course Description}

Before taking a philosophy course, most people are unfamiliar with the subject. So, by way of introduction, here is an excerpt from a lecture on Plato’s dialogue the \textit{Apology} (which we’ll read) by the philosopher Steven Smith, 
\begin{quote}
Philosophy grows out of a desire to replace opinion with knowledge, to replace opinion or belief with reason. For philosophy, it is not enough simply to hold a belief on faith, but one must be able to give a rational account, a reasoned account for one’s belief. Its goal, again, is to replace civic faith with rational knowledge. And, therefore, philosophy is necessarily at odds with belief and with this kind of civic faith. … The philosopher seeks to judge those beliefs in the light of true standards, in the light of what is always and everywhere true, as a quest for knowledge. There is a necessary and inevitable tension between philosophy and mere belief.
\end{quote}

Philosophy is different than science, but only to a degree. Science investigates the world by collecting data and doing experiments. Philosophy, meanwhile, usually undertakes neither of these activities. But still, the philosopher seeks knowledge, and the tool for seeking knowledge in this domain is reason. Given some facts (perhaps uncovered by science), what follows? What is likely to be---or must be---true? 

The theme of this course is challenging our beliefs. There are things that we want to believe, for instance, that we are real, that we have free will, that a god exists. How well do these beliefs hold up when we examine them and consider the evidence? We’ll see.

We will start out with a topic that doesn’t challenge our beliefs: arguments. These are the basic tool for doing philosophy. Next, we’ll consider Galileo. That the earth revolves around the sun shouldn’t challenge what you believe, but it sets the stage for the topics to follow. Why, in his day, was Galileo’s claim that the earth revolves around the sun threatening? What role did the evidence have in the debate about whether the sun revolves around the earth or the earth revolves around the sun? What else was a factor? 

After Galileo, we will examine the following questions. What is the mind and who has one? What does it take to be a person? Do we have free will? Are we living in a computer simulation? And does God exist? These are real questions, not philosophical exercises. Although interestingly, how these questions turn out doesn’t affect our day-to-day lives. When people finally accepted that the earth is not the center of the universe, nothing really changed (except for astronomers). Similarly, if it turns out that we don’t have free will or that we’re living in a computer simulation, you will still go on with your life. Nothing will suddenly seem different.

In the last three weeks of the semester, we will read two of Plato’s dialogues, the \textit{Apology} and the \textit{Crito}. The first is an account of the trial of Socrates. The ancient Greek philosopher Socrates was put on trial for, essentially, the very thing that this course is about, questioning commonly held beliefs and seeking knowledge. He was found guilty, and in the \textit{Crito} Socrates is waiting to be put to death. Here Plato examines the relationship between the individual citizen, especially one like Socrates, and the state.\\

\noindent This is an online course, and it is not designed to be too similar to a classroom course. Instead
of lectures being the central feature of the course, you will be working independently on the
readings. I am available and will be in contact with you, and you should email me as often
as you find useful. But think of this course as a very structured independent study (that
is, structured by by me for you) rather than as a standard classroom course. See also the
additional information about the course in the first module in Canvas.

\section{Coursework \& Grading}

Letter grades will be assigned using the standard Mississippi State scale (an A is 90 – 100 percent, a B is 80 – 89 percent, a C is 70 – 79 percent, etc.). The grades will be set based on this coursework and these percentages:
\begin{description}
\item quizzes: 15 percent
\item homework \& discussion assignments: 45 percent
\item three papers: 40 percent
\end{description}
The quizzes will consist of multiple choice questions, and they are open-book assignments
(although you have to take them alone). Generally, there will be one or two quizzes per week.
In addition to the quizzes, most weeks there will be a homework or discussion assignment. 
Three longer writing assignments (about 2 to 4 pages) will be due on these dates:
\begin{description}
\item paper 1: Sunday, February 14
\item paper 2: Sunday, March 21
\item paper 3: Sunday, April 25
\end{description}
Every due date is firm. Quizzes, homework assignments, and discussion assignments cannot be completed after their due dates. Papers will be accepted late, but late paper will be penalized. Briefly, the reasons for this are as follows. First, although different professors have different policies, when you sign up for a course, you are agreeing to work within the schedule set for that course. If you can’t do that—for whatever reason (good or bad)—you should expect that your grade will be affected. Second, it is necessary
to keep the entire class organized and moving in the right direction. For large classes especially, it’s not possible to do that and have flexible due dates.
