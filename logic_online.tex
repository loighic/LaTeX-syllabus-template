\section{Textbook \& Software}

We will begin with the chapter ``An Introduction to Arguments,'' which is posted on Canvas. Then, for the rest of the semester, we will use the textbook \textit{forall\,x: the Mississippi State edition}. The information for ordering this book is on Canvas. Starting in week 5, we will use the free online logic software Carnap (\url{http://carnap.io/}). A link that you will use to set up an account in Carnap will be provided.

\section{Course Description}

\input{files/logic-description}

If you are having trouble with any part of this course, please contact me right away. The course is designed to make working through the material and learning it a straightforward process. Since this is an online course, however, you are responsible for 
\begin{description}
\item[1.] making time each week to do the work for the course, 
\item[2.] using the textbook and videos to complete the assignments, and 
\item[3.] determining if and when you need to contact me with questions. 
\end{description}
Again, don’t hesitate to contact me. It’s what I’m here for, and I don’t mind answering questions.


\section{Learning Objectives}

After the successful completion of this course, students will be able to identify arguments, distinguish valid and invalid arguments, translate English sentences into sentences in a formal language (TFL), construct truth tables, evaluate arguments using truth tables, and construct proofs in a formal language (TFL).

\section{Coursework \& Grading}

Letter grades will be assigned using the standard Mississippi State scale (an A is 90 – 100 percent, a B is 80 – 89 percent, a C is 70 – 79 percent, etc.). The grades will be set based on this coursework and these percentages:
\begin{description}
\item quizzes and homework assignments: 65 percent
\item three tests: 35 percent
\end{description}

\noindent All of the work for this course is open book and notes (your own notes, not other people’s notes). \textbf{Other than consulting with the instructor, you are required to do all quizzes, homework assignments, and tests alone and without help.} You can work on the practice quizzes and practice problems with other students. 

Because everything in this course builds what you have done previously, you have to do every assignment. (That is, you have to do every quiz, practice quiz, homework assignment, and test; you don’t, however, have to do all of the practice problems in Carnap). Assignments can be completed after their due dates, but there are penalties for completing them late. 
\begin{description}
\item[1.] For quizzes and tests in Canvas, 3 percent will be deducted from an assignment's grade for each day that it is late. 
\item[2.] For homework assignments in Carnap, late work will receive a 20 percent penalty (that is just a penalty for being late, not a per day penalty). 
\end{description}
Generally, there will be three or four assignments due per week. Each student's two lowest quiz or homework grades will be dropped. There will not be any extra credit at the end of the course, and so you should do as well as you can throughout the semester.

\paragraph{Honorlock} You will use the proctoring software Honorlock for some of the tests. There is information about using it on Canvas, but right now, you should make sure that you have a working webcam---either the webcam built into your laptop or an external one (which doesn't have to be HD or otherwise fancy).
