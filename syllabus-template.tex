\section{Course Description}

Before taking a philosophy course, most people are unfamiliar with the subject. So, by way of introduction, here is an excerpt from a lecture on Plato’s dialogue the \textit{Apology} (which we’ll read) by the philosopher Steven Smith, 
\begin{quote}
Philosophy grows out of a desire to replace opinion with knowledge, to replace opinion or belief with reason. For philosophy, it is not enough simply to hold a belief on faith, but one must be able to give a rational account, a reasoned account for one’s belief. Its goal, again, is to replace civic faith with rational knowledge. And, therefore, philosophy is necessarily at odds with belief and with this kind of civic faith. … The philosopher seeks to judge those beliefs in the light of true standards, in the light of what is always and everywhere true, as a quest for knowledge. There is a necessary and inevitable tension between philosophy and mere belief.
\end{quote}

Philosophy is different than science, but only to a degree. Science investigates the world by collecting data and doing experiments. Philosophy, meanwhile, usually does neither of these things. But still, the philosopher seeks knowledge, and the tool for seeking knowledge is reason. Given some facts (perhaps uncovered by science), what follows? What is likely to be---or must be---true? \ldots


\section{Learning Objectives}

Naturally, one objective is to become acquainted with the assigned material. Other, no less important, goals are improving your reading comprehension, critical thinking, and writing skills.

\section{Coursework \& Grading}

Letter grades will be assigned using the standard Mississippi State scale (an A is 90 – 100 percent, a B is 80 – 89 percent, a C is 70 – 79 percent, etc.). The grades will be set based on this coursework and these percentages:
\begin{description}
\item quizzes \& assignments: 30 percent
\item paper: 15 percent
\item three tests: 55 percent
\end{description}

A 5 to 6 page paper will be due near the end of the semester. . . .
