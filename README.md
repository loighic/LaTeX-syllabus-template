# LaTeX syllabus template

I'm partial to replacing the standard course syllabus with an "infographic" (see, for example, https://sites.google.com/view/chiahualin/teaching), but, at least for the time being, I'm stuck in the traditional syllabus rut. 

This syllabus template is set up to pull the various different elements that have to be included into one document. 

Use XeLaTeX to compile. If you don't have the fonts that I've used, you can either download them (they're all free) or change them. (They're listed in the middle of the syllabus.sty file.)
