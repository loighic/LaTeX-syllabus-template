# LaTeX syllabus template

I'm becoming partial to replacing the standard course syllabus with an "infographic" (see, for example, https://sites.google.com/view/chiahualin/teaching), but some schools (like mine) are pretty strict about having a comprehensive syllabus for each course. 

This syllabus template is set up to pull the various different elements that have to be included into one document. If you're teaching at Mississippi State, then you'll be able to use the sections that are included in the files folder. If you're somewhere else, you'll, obviously, have to modify them to suit your needs.
