\section{Preliminaries}

\noindent Email is the best way to reach me, and I will usually respond within 24 hours. If you would like a more immediate response, you can try calling or sending a text message to 267-416-0292. But don’t leave a voicemail. I won’t get it.

%With suitable notice, I may make any changes to the syllabus, readings, assignments, or schedule at any time during the semester.
