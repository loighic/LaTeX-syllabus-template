\section{Email \& Using the Internet}

It is assumed that all students are familiar with the internet. Nonetheless, if you have any questions, please ask. 

For this class (and probably for all of your classes), you have to check your Mississippi State email frequently. If you don’t want to bother with another email account, then forward your Mississippi State email to your personal email account. Instructions for how to do that are here: \url{https://www.its.msstate.edu/files/BullyMailForward1.pdf}.

Occasionally students have trouble connecting to Canvas or getting it to work properly. If this happens, it is often useful to try a different web browser (and this is more worthwhile than trying a different computer). If you are using a PC, you probably already have Internet Explorer; and if you are using a Mac, you probably already have Safari. These are the best alternatives to Internet Explorer and Safari:
\begin{description}
\item Firefox, \url{http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/} 
\item Chrome, \url{http://www.google.com/chrome/} 
\item Opera, \url{http://www.opera.com/}
\end{description}
Try using one of them if Canvas is giving you trouble (use the link to download the browser if you don’t already have it installed on your computer).

That being said, you are responsible for making sure that you have access to Canvas. If you wait until the last moment to complete an assignment and then run into computer or internet problems, the assignment will be late or won't be counted at all---no exceptions will be made for you.
