\section{Title IX}

MSU is committed to complying with Title IX, a federal law that prohibits discrimination, including violence and harassment, based on sex.  This means that MSU’s educational programs and activities must be free from sex discrimination, sexual harassment, and other forms of sexual misconduct.  If you or someone you know has experienced sex discrimination, sexual violence, or harassment by any member of the University community, you are encouraged to report the conduct to MSU’s Director of Title IX/EEO Programs at 662-325-8124 or by e-mail to \url{titleix@msstate.edu}.
