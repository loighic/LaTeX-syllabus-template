\section{Student Honor Code \& Academic Misconduct}

Mississippi State has an approved Honor Code that applies to all students. The code is as follows: 
\begin{quote}
\vspace{-2mm}
\textcolor{red1}{As a Mississippi State University student, I will conduct myself with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do.}
\vspace{-2mm}
\end{quote}
Upon accepting admission to Mississippi State University, a student immediately assumes a commitment to uphold the Honor Code, to accept responsibility for learning, and to follow the philosophy and rules of the Honor Code. Student will be required to state their commitment on examinations, research papers, and other academic work. Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the MSU community from the requirements or the processes of the Honor Code. For additional information, please visit: \url{http://honorcode.msstate.edu/policy} and \url{http://students.msstate.edu/studentconduct/}.

\textbf{To be clear, students who cheat in any way will be penalized. Cheating includes giving as well as receiving help when such help is not explicitly allowed.} Plagiarism is also a form of cheating. The best way to avoid anything that might be academic misconduct is to put yourself in a position where you don't need to cheat or plagiarize. Don't get behind, and if there are things that you don't understand, give yourself time to figure them out or ask me about them.

If you have any further questions about what constitutes cheating, either ask me or see the Universityâ€™s policy on academic dishonesty. (I am happy to answer to any questions about what is and is not allowed. But ask me before you do something questionable.)
