The Academic Tutoring and Writing Center is available to help students with any part of the writing process, from understanding the assignment to the finished product. The ATWC mainly operates virtually through Canvas, but it is also available for in-person meetings at the College Park campus on Wednesdays from 3:30 â€“ 5:30 pm (no appointment needed). For more information, contact Leslie Pevey (\url{atwc@meridian.msstate.edu}; or, on Wednesdays between 3:30 and 5:30 pm, you can call 601-484-0248).
