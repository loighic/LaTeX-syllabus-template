Students who need academic accommodations based on a disability should visit the Student Support Services located on the upper level of the College Park campus and speak with Ms. Amy Smith (\url{asmith@meridian.msstate.edu}, 601-484-0234). This should be done before any class assignments are due. Further information about academic accommodations as well as other student services is available here: \url{http://www.meridian.msstate.edu/student-services}.

Academic accommodations and services are based on an individualâ€™s needs.  All documentation is confidential.
