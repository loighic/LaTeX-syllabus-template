\section{Two Other Rules}

\begin{description}
\item[(1)] Cell phone use, including texting, is not allowed in class. 
\item[(2)] You may not use a laptop or tablet in class. 
\end{description}

\noindent You may, at the very beginning of class, put upcoming assignments into your phone. But besides that exception, I should never see a cell phone or an open laptop during class.
These rules are designed to benefit you. Although you (sitting in class) may not perceive texting as rude or distracting, the person who is addressing you will usually interpret it negatively. This applies, not only to professors, but to the people you will work with and work for once you graduate. Learning to manage when you look at and use your phone is a good habit to develop now.

Laptop use can also, in some situations, be perceived as rude, and often it is obvious that the laptop user is not just taking notes. But more importantly, using a laptop creates an enormous barrier to paying attention. Every student who uses a laptop in the classroom spends time on things that are not related to class (email, Facebook, etc.). Consequently, these students get little or no benefit from being in the classroom, and the students’ grades indicate as much. (And don’t think that you’re good at ``multi-tasking.'' You’re not. The human brain doesn’t work that way.)
