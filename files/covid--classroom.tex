\subsection{MSU facial covering policy} 

To safeguard the health of all members of the MSU campus during this global pandemic, the university has reconfigured classroom spaces and adjusted room capacities to assure adequate physical distance between all individuals in each room.  In addition, the university has published requirements for the use of face coverings for everyone on campus, including specific requirements for their use in all classrooms, labs, and shared office spaces regardless of physical distancing.  In order to mutually protect the students’ freedom to learn and the instructor’s ability to teach in a safe classroom environment, everyone in this classroom is required to wear a face covering in the classroom in accordance with MSU policy (\href{https://www.msstate.edu/covid19/return-plan}{\textit{Comprehensive Health \& Safety Return Plan}}).  If a student cannot wear a face covering due to a medical condition, he or she should request an accommodation via the Office of Disability Support Services.  \textcolor{red1}{If a student simply doesn’t want to wear a face covering, he or she will not be permitted to remain in the classroom or lab.}


\subsection{Course continuity in the event of an online migration} 

In the event that face-to-face classes are suspended due to the pandemic or its effects, the instructor will continue instruction in a manner that best supports the course content and student engagement. In this event, all instructors will notify all students of the change via their university email address (the official vehicle for communication with students).  At that time, they will provide details about how instruction and communication will continue, how academic integrity will be ensured, and what students may expect during the time that face-to-face classes are suspended. If a student becomes unable to continue class participation, the student should contact their instructor and advisor for guidance.
